## Overview

Book Notes Catalog offers users a platform to track, sort, and rate non-fiction books they've read, along with storing notes and book metadata such as the author, genre, and more. The project is built using Node.js for the backend, with an EJS templating engine for rendering dynamic HTML, and a MySQL database to store the book data.
